# DaBananaGame

This is my mid term project at Lighthouse Labs.  I made this app with a partner name Hamza Lakhani and was given a week to present the project.  This project was created during week 5 of the bootcamp.  

This is the first project that I learn how to use sprite kit framework.  Sprite kit was brand new to me and it was the first time I learn a brand new framework without any guidance, because most of the instructors/mentors at Lighthouse Labs didn't learn the sprite kit framework.  So I was really proud of myself being able to create a game that was playable, but at the moment I designed the game to be impossible to beat.
